title: Our Mission
---

At UliftU, we provide the tools for the unemployed, re-entering citizens, and homeless to achieve wellness.
We believe that success for our members means sustainable employment, access to quality nutrition and physical and emotional strength

## Goals

* Providing income for our members. Members are paid through [our program](/program) for their time coaching classes at this location.

* Much needed opportunities for local residents to access [fitness programming](/classes) and work towards reducing preventable health conditions. 


Beyond preparing for jobs within the existing health and wellness world, we will have a social enterprise through which our members will deliver fitness programming for private clients, corporate wellness and as a part of social service programming in disadvantaged communities where healthy lifestyles are often rare.


Each member makes a commitment to themselves and the community upon joining UliftU and that contract defines their involvement. The benefits of UliftU include; a paid stipend for training, transportation and access to nutrition through our food share partner.
